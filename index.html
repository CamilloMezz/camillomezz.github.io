	<h2>Hello World!</h2>

		<p>I recently graduated my <strong>Master's Degree in International Marketing & Management</strong> at Copenhagen Business School an am now looking for an exiting and challenging job opportunity on entrance level marketing. I will be attending the <a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com">Startup Institute</a> in New York during this summer in order to complement my know-how with technical marketing skills.

		<p>I have lived in four different countries over the last six years and am a very international person. My experience has made me a strong communicator, fast integrator, and above all a team player. I am an entrepreneurial spirit and passionate about the retail x sports x nutrition x tech industries besides my unerlying interests in innovation and trends. I am very motivated to donate my enthusiasm to an innovative company and to contribute to a top team of inspiring individuals. <em>I bring smiles, action, and ideas!</em></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Topics I Am Interested In</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Big Data</li>
					<li>Smart Wearables</li>
					<li>Disruptive Changes vs. Disruptive Chances</li>
					<li>Integrated Marketing Models</li>

				</ul>
